Readme File for Pytest Code
This readme file provides information on how to run and use the pytest code. The pytest code is a collection of test functions that use the pytest framework to test specific functionalities of the code.

Getting Started
To use the pytest code, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. Once you have Python 3 installed, you can install pytest using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

pip install pytest

Running the Tests
To run the tests, navigate to the directory containing the pytest code and run the following command in your terminal:

pytest

This will run all the tests in the directory and its subdirectories. If you want to run a specific test, you can specify the name of the test file or test function using the following command:

pytest path/to/test_file.py::test_function

Understanding the Test Results
When you run the tests, pytest will provide you with detailed information on the test results. Each test function will be labeled either as passed or failed. If a test fails, pytest will provide you with information on which line of code caused the failure and the expected and actual outputs.

Modifying the Tests
If you want to modify the tests to test additional functionalities or edge cases, you can do so by editing the test functions. The pytest framework provides a range of assert statements that you can use to test different types of inputs and outputs. Refer to the pytest documentation for more information on assert statements.

Conclusion
The pytest code provides a convenient way to test specific functionalities of your code. By using the pytest framework, you can quickly identify bugs and edge cases that may be missed during manual testing. If you have any questions or issues with the pytest code, feel free to reach out to the developer or refer to the pytest documentation.
